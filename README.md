 ****Industrial Copper Modeling Project****
                                                                                          

**Project Overview**

The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to address challenges in the copper industry related to sales and pricing using machine learning techniques. The project involves developing regression and classification models to predict selling prices and lead outcomes, respectively. Additionally, a Streamlit web application is created to interactively showcase the models.

**Skills Developed**

**1.Python Scripting**: 

  Proficiency in Python programming language.

**2.Data Preprocessing:** 

  Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.

**3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 

  Visualizing data distributions, outliers, and skewness.

**4.Machine Learning:**

  Building regression and classification models using Scikit-learn.

**5.Streamlit:**

  Creating an interactive web application for model deployment.

**6.Feature Engineering:**

  Transforming and creating new features for improved model performance.

**7.GitHub and Version Control:** 

  Maintaining codebase on GitHub in a modular and organized manner.

**8.Coding Standards:**

  Following PEP 8 coding standards for clean and readable code.

**Project Structure**

**1.Data Understanding:**

- Identifying variable types and distributions.
- Treating rubbish values in 'Material_Reference' as null.
- Treating reference columns as categorical variables.

**2.Data Preprocessing:**
- Handling missing values using mean/median/mode.
- Treating outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest.
- Treating skewness with appropriate transformations.
- Encoding categorical variables using suitable techniques.

**3.EDA:**
- Visualizing outliers and skewness with Seaborn's plots.

**4.Feature Engineering:**
